# Visual-Html-Editor-For-Fivem
I'm making a multipurpose Visual html editor designed to make macho menus with either dui or nui its in its early stages right now but I'm planning to make it multipurpose and high quality but for now it should work to visually design complex html's

Update Plans:
-- expect most these to get done some time in the next 2 months or so(don't hound me I like free-time every now and again, updates will happen when they happen).
1. Full handling to for nested menus and creation of complex Phaze like html designs.
2. Automated Js creation for Instant working lua menu struct that can easily be altered.
3. Automatic nui message creation and lua handling.
4. Handling to import any custom html to edit and save or even just import an html to directly save into a lua struct.
5. Eventually Improve lua struct to a default menu generation which would allow custom open key and work immediately upon saving.

Later Additions:
-- things i might(probably will) do but arent really needed.
1. Standard macho menu visual editing in pure lua via an interpreter

Update Log:
1. Initial release MMM.py (Macho Menu Maker) -- Currently a working visual editor for htmls is implemented but its not nearly perfected I'm posting this earlier than I normally would post something because I think its a very promising design

2. Html Import partially working finalization coming soon.
